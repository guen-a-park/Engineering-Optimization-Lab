# Bearing Damage Prediction

Development of anomaly detection model based on time series data from Nasa Bearing Dataset.

[data description]()

### Overview

Development process for anomaly detection is as follows.

(a) Preprocessing to extract data features with Wavelet Transform

(b) Create models through supervised or unsupervised learning in the training process

(c) After setting the threshold, the generated training model detects outliers

### Model

Supervised Learning

-  Additive Regression Model

Unsupervised Learning

- linear model-based methods: PCA 

- deep learning-based methods: AE(Autoencoder)

### Conclusion

TBU
