# Engineering Optimization lab

(21.07.06~21.08.31)

I worked as an undergraduate research internship during 2021 summer vacation at Multi-Disciplinary, Multi-Physics, Multi-Scale Design and Optimization Lab in School of Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University.

These were the topics that I studied.

- Nasa-Bearing-Dataset : Prognostic Dataset for Predictive/Preventive Maintenance  & Reservoir Computing
- Wavelet Filter-based Weak Signature Detection Method and its Application on Roller Bearing Prognostics

- Reservoir Computing
